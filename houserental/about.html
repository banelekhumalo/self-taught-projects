                  <i>Banele Khumalo</i> the creator of this system, it is a training system more like a practise ground. Throw your stones, I will catch them and build more system. This is the first of many that are coming.

                    Little story about the programmer!</b>
                <br/>
                 I was born and raised ekasi, small township in east rand called Tsakane and some they call it Mashona. We are people of style, intellects, entertainers, educated individuals and a united kasi. We are happy, we have the best infrastructure, we have beautiful places.<br/>
                
                    Growing up was very awesome, knowing very well that your environment and surroundings individuals are positive, goal driven beings and the whole kasi raised us, like they always say "It takes the whole village to raise a child". I never thought being a programmer would be something that will put bread on top of the table, but hey look at us pressing keybords, waisting data for a good use.<br/>
                  
                    Banele enjoys seeing people united, I love sharing what I know and learning from others. I have this massive room in my heart to take all the criticism and learn from it, I believe in second chances, I am not scared to fail trying. 
                  
                  
              </p>
               <p>
                  This is my playground, a platform for me to explore things and expand my skills. I am still learnig and I would also like you to be part of it. Are you having ideas but you do not know where to turn? I am here, let's uplift each other.
                  <br/>
                  If you see that there are other better ways to make this system a very functional website, I'd appreciate your inputs. We are not going to stop pressing these keys until something fruitful comes out. <br/>
                  
                  I hope this website will inspire you not to give up, and encourouges you to go big and be great. Please do not forget that it is never too late to start from scratch, it is time for to make the right choices.<br/><br/> Wait I do not want to sound like I am preaching, or motivating. What I am trying to tell you is that  corona virus affected us all and we ended up creating system like this. Some people hmmmm, let me not mention those stories, Some could not even survive three days locked with with the wife and the kids. Gain weight???
